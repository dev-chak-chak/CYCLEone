## Test methods 
A test method is any procedure that fulfils test goals. A test method may consist of
* Choice of test practices (requirements-based testing, scenario-based testing, model-based testing)
* Test level (system test level, integration test level)
* Test environments (HIL, SIL, MIL, VIL, proving ground, real road testing)
* Test techniques (equivalence partitioning, state-based testing, failure injection test (?)
* Applicable procedures/processes (postprocessing, risk assessment)
* Choice of coverage criteria
So, a test method represents a partial implementation of the test strategy.

## Test case
According to ISO 29119 test case is a set of test case preconditions, inputs (including actions, where applicable), and expected results, developed to drive the execution of a test item to meet test objectives,
including correct implementation, error identification, checking quality, and other valued information

## Scenario
